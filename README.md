# In this app I designed the TIP Calculator using ES5 syntax and MVC.
## The app.js file is structured on 3 parts. 
### - the Tip-calculator module(makes calculations based on the input that the user provides),
### - UI-module(display in the UI the values, using the tip-calculator data) and 
### - the app-controller which is the brain of the app, takes the values of the first two components and do what it needs in order to be everything as expected.
